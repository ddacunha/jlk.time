# time

a number of clojure wrappers around joda time.

## Usage

function 'time' will produce a joda object when given an appropriate java object or string and formatter.  eg.

(time 123456) creates from a Long timestamp
(time (java.util.Date. xxx)) from a java Date object
(time (java.sql.Date. xxx)) from a java sql Date object
(time "2012" (formatter "YYYY")) from a string and format object
(time "2012-02-03" (formatter :iso-date)) from a string and format object

function 'convert' works in the opposite direction.  eg.
(convert (now) :java) -> java.util.Date
(convert (now) (formatter "YYYY")) -> String

there are also convienience functions 'now' and 'timestamp'
